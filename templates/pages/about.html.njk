        JSConf EU is a professional, not-for-profit, labour-of-love conference for the
        JavaScript community. It’s a two day affair, with many related side events in the
        days surrounding it. JSConf EU is an invitation for the community to come together
        and for new people to get to know and join the community.

      <p>
        If you have a desire to learn more about your profession or hobby and get energized
        about JavaScript, then this conference is for you.
       </p>

      <p>
        The heart of the conference are ~45 presentations spread over two days with topics
        ranging from deep technical journeys into JavaScript and what can be done with it to
        the big question of why we are all doing this and how we could do it better.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is rounded off with social events on the evenings before, the days of, and the
        morning and midday after the conference. The socials are meant as a conductor for
        people to have the chance to meet each other, discuss the topics of the talks, and,
        above everything else, make real connections and maybe find new friends.
       </p>
      <p>
        JSConf EU celebrates its host city Berlin. What better way to invite all of Berlin
        to the event! The socials are open for the entire Berlin tech community as well as
        the conference attendees. This allows the local technology scene to meet all the
        great people (you!) who made their way to Berlin and vice versa.

      <h2 id="the-good-stuff">The Good Stuff</h2>

      <p>A JSConf EU ticket includes the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A wide range of refreshing drinks and overflowing coffee including a barista making coffee on request.</li>
        <li>Both days include a full breakfast and lunch with delicious options for omnivores, vegetarians, vegans, and people with celiac disease. If you have any special dietary requirements, please let us know, so we can accommodate you.</li>
        <li>On Friday, we provide a full dinner for CSSconf attendees, before the social event. The social event is open to all ticket holders.</li>
        <li>On Sunday, the dinner is on you, but we all meet again at the social event site, and we will host it somewhere with a variety of street food and restaurant options nearby.</li>
        <li>On Monday, we provide a relaxing brunch with conference attendees who are on their way back home. Conveniently located close to a transit hub, so getting to trains and planes is a snap.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="caring-for-attendees">Caring for Attendees</h2>

      <p>Everybody is welcome at JSConf EU and to make sure everybody feels at home, we’d like to point out that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We provide a friendly, welcoming atmosphere for you to have engaging conversations with people who share your interests.</li>
        <li>We aim to make the venue fully accessible. Fine print: Let us know if you have any specific needs. We will refund your ticket if we cannot meet your needs.</li>
        <li>We offer on-site childcare on request. Details are still open, though, and we’d like to hear from you if you’d want to take advantage of this.</li>
        <li>We have real-time captioning of talks to aid the hearing impaired. Let us know if this is relevant to you to guide our decision making.</li>
        <li>We can arrange for sign language interpreters on request. Again, please let us know, so we can plan accordingly.</li>
        <li>While this is a social event and meeting people is a strong focus, we are equally welcoming to the more introverted type of person who prefers to quietly see the talks. You can take a breather by the riverside or in the grassy spaces nearby during the breaks.</li>
      </ul>
