                        means that you will receive an e-mail after registration, in which you will be asked to confirm
                        your registration. This confirmation is necessary so that no one can log on with foreign e-mail
                        addresses. The registrations for the newsletter are recorded in order to be able to prove the
                        registration process according to legal requirements. Therefore we store the login and the
                        confirmation time, as well as the IP address. Also, the changes to your data stored with the

                    <p>The newsletters contain a so-called âweb-beaconâ. A pixel-sized file retrieved from the server of
                        the shipping service provider when the newsletter is opened. Within the framework of this call,
                        technical information, such as information about the browser and your system, as well as your IP
                        address and time of the call-up are collected. This information is used to technically improve
                        the services based on the technical data or the target groups and their reading behavior by
                        means of their polling points (which can be determined using the IP address) or the access
                        times. Statistical surveys also include determining whether the newsletters are opened, when
                        they are opened, and which links are clicked. This information can be assigned to individual
                        newsletter recipients for technical reasons. It is, however, neither our endeavor, nor that of
                        the shipping service provider, to observe individual users. The evaluations are much more useful
                        for us to recognize the reading habits of our users and adapt our content to them or to send
                        different content according to the interests of our users.</p>

                        our newsletter at any time, i.e. revoke your consent. So that goes out at the same time your
                        consents to its dispatch via MailChimp and the statistical analyses. A separate revocation of
                        sending via MailChimp or the statistical evaluation is unfortunately not possible.</p>
