Thank you so much for joining us for CSSconf EU and/or JSConf EU 2018! We're really excited to see you soon in Berlin, but until then, we've created this page to help you with any roadblocks you may be facing on your way there.

If you're arriving by public transport, the closest stations are:

## Venue Information

### Arena Berlin

*Eichenstraße 4, 12435 Berlin*

The entire event, including meals, parties, and everything else takes place in here, so there's no long distances you have to take during the day.

If you're travelling to the venue by taxi, most taxi drivers should recognize the destination if you just say "Arena Berlin". The closest public transport stations are:

- **Treptower Park** (S-Bahn, Bus) — Serviced by the S8, S9, and the Ring lines (S41 and S42). From there, you can walk or take the 165/265 bus lines.
- **Eichenstraße/Puschkinallee** (Bus) — Serviced by exactly those 165/265 lines, as well as the 104 line. From here, the venue is a stone throw away. This station is also reachable from Schlesisches Tor.

## Travel tips

### Travelling by Taxi

If you're going to travel by Taxi, the most important thing to keep in mind is to always ask the driver for a receipt so that we can reimburse it later! In German, that's "Quittung bitte", but most drivers will understand what you're asking for even in English.

### Travelling by public transport

Berlin has an excellent public transport system comprised of S-Bahn (commuter trains), U-Bahn (subway), Buses, Trams, and even ferries! Here's some important things you want to keep in mind if you plan to use it:

- You should get to almost any place within Berlin in 30-40 minutes. However, keep in mind that Berlin often has demonstrations and strikes, and therefore, some modes of transport might be delayed or sometimes even blocked outright.
- Most modes of transport operate on a trust-based ticket system. This means that there's no ticket checking when you get on, but rather, sometimes ticket inspectors do random checks. If you happen not to have a ticket at that point, that's a 60 Euro fine.
- The above is not usually true for buses — the bus driver will want to see your ticket as you get on, but you can also directly buy tickets from him (only with cash, though).
- Berlin has 3 ticket types: AB will get you anywhere within Berlin, ABC will get you anywhere within Berlin *plus* some cities outside of Berlin (like Potsdam), and BC is irrelevant for you. Usually, AB is fine, but if you're arriving from Berlin Schönefeld airport (SXF), you'll need an ABC ticket to get into the city, and the other way around.
- This isn't a formal rule, but in Germany, you're not supposed to make too much noise in public transport vehicles. People will look at you weird, and sometimes ask you to tone it down.

### Airports

Berlin has two airports:

- Berlin Tegel (TXL), which lies in the north of Berlin, is the busiest and also likely the one you'll arrive in if you come from outside of Europe. It's a small and fairly hectic airport, and one of its biggest downsides is that the only means of public transport connection is via bus. Hop onto the TXL bus (yes, the bus line is called TXL), and you'll be at the main station or Alexanderplatz in no time. Alternatively, just take a taxi.
- Berlin Schönefeld (SXF), which lies outside of the city limits in the south, is the low-cost and smaller of the two. Fortunately, it has good train connections, with a commuter train connecting the city centre and the airport arriving every 5-10 minutes. Additionally, there's a regional train that takes you directly to the main station. You can take the commuter train directly until Warschauer Straße and then walk to the hotel from there!

### Major Train Stations

If you're arriving from within Europe, chances are that you're arriving by train. Here's a list of the long-distance train stations in Berlin:

- **Hauptbahnhof (Central Station)** — The biggest and most central one. Good connection to the S-Bahn system and the Tram system.
- **Südkreuz (South Cross)** — Situated at the south of the inner city. Connects to the Ring line as well as the S1 and S2 train lines.
- **Gesundbrunnen/Nordkreuz (North Cross)** — Situated at the north of the inner city. Connects to the Ring line, the S1 and S2 lines, and the U8 subway line.
- **Ostbahnhof (East Station)** — The former central station. A stone throw away from the A&O hotel, just take any eastbound S-Bahn line.

## Things about Berlin that you might want to know

- If you would like to explore the city by bike, you can borrow bikes at a lot of shops, as well as with the "nextbike" stands you'll find scattered around the city. Berlin is a mostly bike-friendly city, but that can't be said about some of its inhabitants. Be aware at all times and you should be good, though.
- Being a capital city, most people in Berlin speak or at least understand English, so there's no need to learn German just for this event.
- If you need hygiene or sanitary products, most corner shops (colloquially called "Spätis") sell those.
- Generally, if you need anything late at night, those corner shops are open until after midnight and have a good selection of common products you'd need.
