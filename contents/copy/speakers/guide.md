## Welcome!

Thank you so much for joining us for JSConf EU 2018! We're really excited to see you soon in Berlin, but until then, we've created this page to help you with any roadblocks you may be facing on your way there.

## Hotel Information

### [nHow Berlin](https://www.nhow-berlin.com/en/)

*Stralauer Allee 3, 10245 Berlin*

We have booked a room for you from Thursday until Monday (unless you confirmed other dates with us or have private accommodation). In case you need assistance with regards to the hotel, you can contact Simone ([simone@jsconf.eu](mailto:simone@jsconf.eu)).

If you're arriving by public transport, the closest stations are:

- **Warschauer Straße** (S-Bahn, U-Bahn, Bus, Tram) — This station is serviced by the S3, S5, S7, and S9 S-Bahn lines, as well as the U1 subway line. It's also a Tram (M10) terminus station.
- **Stralauer Allee** (Bus) — Serviced by the 347 bus line.
- **Schlesisches Tor** (U-Bahn, Bus) — Serviced by the U1/U3 subway as well as various city-bound bus lines.

You will only need an *AB Ticket* to get there. For more information, refer to the transport section.

## Venue Information

### Arena Berlin

*Eichenstraße 4, 12435 Berlin*

The entire event, including meals, parties, and everything else takes place in here, so there's no long distances you have to take during the day.

If you're travelling to the venue by taxi, most taxi drivers should recognize the destination if you just say "Arena Berlin". The closest public transport stations are:

- **Treptower Park** (S-Bahn, Bus) — Serviced by the S8, S9, and the Ring lines (S41 and S42). From there, you can walk or take the 165/265 bus lines.
- **Eichenstraße/Puschkinallee** (Bus) — Serviced by exactly those 165/265 lines, as well as the 104 line. From here, the venue is a stone throw away. This station is also reachable from Schlesisches Tor.

## Travel, Bookings & Reimbursements

For most of you, everything is already booked. If you do need reimbursement, please contact Feli ([feli@jsconf.eu](mailto:feli@jsconf.eu)) or Simone ([simone@jsconf.eu](mailto:simone@jsconf.eu))! They'll help you figure everything out. If your company has offered to pay: Awesome, thanks! We’d be happy to list them as a supporter on our website, so just let us know if that’s the case.

## A Note on Language

JSConf EU aims to be an inclusive event and to that end we have incorporated [a section on inclusive language in our Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct). Please make sure you read [the section “Inclusive Language” on our Code of Conduct page](/code-of-conduct) before giving your talk. We will enforce the [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct) with anyone who participates in JSConf EU, including speakers.

## Technical Information and Schedule

* The day will start at 8:30am with breakfast and registration; talks will begin at 9:30am. You should arrive before 9:30am, so that we can set up your notebook for a test run and make sure everything works well.
* As a speaker or MC, you won’t have to queue at the venue for check-in, you can come to the registration desk directly. You will then get your speaker bag and your conference pass.
* Projector resolution is 1080p, 16:9.
* You can connect to the projector with VGA, HDMI or DVI. Adapters will be provided.
* We will have a WolfVision presenter for mobile devices. Please let us know in advance if you need to use this.
* You can connect your notebook to the stage audio. A cable will be provided.
* There will be power supplies.
* You can choose between a headset or a clip-on, so you’ll have your hands free during your talk.
* A presentation clicker can be provided.
* Stage WiFi as well as ethernet access will be available.
* Each talk slot is 25 minutes, no Q&A. We believe it’s much better to discuss things in smaller groups afterwards and you’ll have enough time and space to do that.
* Please arrive at the stage about 10 minutes before your talk, so you can set up properly. The MC who will introduce you will be your contact person before the talk.
* All talks will be professionally recorded and released after the conference. They will be publicly accessible for free, so that everyone can learn from the awesome presentations you delivered. If you wish not to have your talk recorded and published, or have any issues regarding copyright (incl. embedded images, music or similar), please let us know in advance.

## Accessibility

One item of frequent feedback from past years that we wanted to share with you:

Attendees often have trouble reading code on the projector screens. This is true for code on slides (we understand if it is too late to change, just wanted to mention it) where it is usually best to choose the biggest possible font size that would fit on the slide all aesthetics aside – but it is even more true for code in your editor during live coding. Please take a moment to find out how to adjust font size in your favorite editor or tool such as Chrome DevTools and then switch to something in the range of 24px text.

## Parties and Social Events

Read more and how to register [here](https://ti.to/jsconfeu/jsconf-eu-2018).

## Code of Conduct
One very important point: We’re an inclusive community event and we want JSConf EU to be a safe place for everyone to make new friends, share knowledge, learn new stuff, get excited and gain insights reglardless of skin colour, gender, religious views, sexual preference, etc.

We want our community to be tolerant and welcoming, and everyone at the conference is required to agree and act according to our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct). – Should you encounter or observe any form of harrassment, please let us know and we’ll take care of it!

## Travel tips

### Travelling by Taxi

If you're going to travel by Taxi (which is recommended if you're staying at the speaker hotel), the most important thing to keep in mind is to always ask the driver for a receipt so that we can reimburse it later! In German, that's "Quittung bitte", but most drivers will understand what you're asking for even in English.

### Travelling by public transport

Berlin has an excellent public transport system comprised of S-Bahn (commuter trains), U-Bahn (subway), Buses, Trams, and even ferries! Here's some important things you want to keep in mind if you plan to use it:

- You should get to almost any place within Berlin in 30-40 minutes. However, keep in mind that Berlin often has demonstrations and strikes, and therefore, some modes of transport might be delayed or sometimes even blocked outright.
- Most modes of transport operate on a trust-based ticket system. This means that there's no ticket checking when you get on, but rather, sometimes ticket inspectors do random checks. If you happen not to have a ticket at that point, that's a 60 Euro fine.
- The above is not usually true for buses — the bus driver will want to see your ticket as you get on, but you can also directly buy tickets from him (only with cash, though).
- Berlin has 3 ticket types: AB will get you anywhere within Berlin, ABC will get you anywhere within Berlin *plus* some cities outside of Berlin (like Potsdam), and BC is irrelevant for you. Usually, AB is fine, but if you're arriving from Berlin Schönefeld airport (SXF), you'll need an ABC ticket to get into the city, and the other way around.

### Airports

Berlin has two airports:

- Berlin Tegel (TXL), which lies in the north of Berlin, is the busiest and also likely the one you'll arrive in if you come from outside of Europe. It's a small and fairly hectic airport, and one of its biggest downsides is that the only means of public transport connection is via bus. Hop onto the TXL bus (yes, the bus line is called TXL), and you'll get to the main station or Alexanderplatz. Alternatively, just take a taxi (remember, we'll reimburse you for it).
- Berlin Schönefeld (SXF), which lies outside of the city limits in the south, is the low-cost and smaller of the two. Fortunately, it has good train connections, with a commuter train connecting the city centre and the airport arriving every 5-10 minutes. Additionally, there's a regional train that takes you directly to the main station. You can take the commuter train (S9) directly until Warschauer Straße and then walk to the hotel from there!

## Some useful facts about Berlin

- If you would like to explore the city by bike, the hotel has its own bike rental system. Just ask at the reception desk and you'll be good to go! Berlin is a mostly bike-friendly city, but that can't be said about some of its inhabitants. Be aware at all times and you should be good, though.
- Being a capital city, most people in Berlin speak or at least understand English, so there's no need to learn German just for this event.
- If you need hygiene or sanitary products, most corner shops (colloquially called "Spätis") sell those.
- Generally, if you need anything late at night, those corner shops are open until after midnight and have a good selection of common products you'd need.

See you all in Berlin!
