  What Time Is It?
</div>

For most of our attendees and volunteer team, time works in [CET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_European_Time). That’s why all time information on our website (for talk schedules, ticket sales, etc.) is in CET. If that is not helpful for you, [this converter](https://savvytime.com/converter/utc-to-cet) should do the trick. 🙌 ⏰
