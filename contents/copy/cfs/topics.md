## Topics

To get a feel for what we are interested in hearing about, here is the programme for past years ([2012](http://2012.jsconf.eu/speakers.html), [2013](http://2013.jsconf.eu/speakers/), [2014](http://2014.jsconf.eu/speakers/), [2015](http://2015.jsconf.eu/speakers/)).

We like to see anything that squarely fits into the spectrum of:

 * Cutting-edge technological advances in the world of JavaScript or computer science in general, if somehow applicable to JavaScript
 * Wild Ideas & Clever Hacks
 * Improving JavaScript developers’ lives
 * Mobile JS
 * Embedded JS
 * Hardware JS
 * Fundamentals, in a modern light
 * The JavaScript community, culture, history, past, present & future, the why the who and the what of what we’re all doing
 * And finally: Whatever the hell you want; this is your conference

For further inspiration, check out the video recordings of [JSConf EU 2017’s talks on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL37ZVnwpeshFmAPr65sU2O5WMs7_CGjs_).

And remember: Pick whatever you feel passionate about. This is your conference!

PS: If you can’t find a suitable topic for JSConf EU, or you want to try your luck at more than one event, then consider submitting a talk to our partner conference CSSconf EU – it’s happening in the same venue on the same weekend, and you’re welcome to submit multiple talks.
