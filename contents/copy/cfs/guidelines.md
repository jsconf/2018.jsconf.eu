## Guidelines

* Language: all talks are in English.
* Talk Duration: talks should be 30 minutes long (for longer talks we’ll get in touch with you directly). We will be on a tight schedule and will enforce the time limits rigorously. We suggest that you time your presentation accordingly in advance.
* Formatting: make sure you care, and make sure we see you care. Typos, sloppy formatting and all-lowercase submissions make our reading of your proposal tedious and will reflect negatively on the outcome of your submission.
* Brevity: don’t get too wordy. If you need more than two paragraphs to get to the point of your proposal, we ask you to slim things down. With the amount of submissions we get, the quicker you can make a good first impression, the better.
* Originality: one of the things we want to do at JSConf EU is to push the community forward. We can’t do this if the same people talk about the same things all the time. Thus, we favor original content. If you want to present a topic that you have talked about elsewhere, try to add a twist, new research or development to it — something to make it unique.
