## Perks

If your proposal is selected, here’s what you’ll get:

Travel to Berlin - this usually means that we’ll pay for your plane or train ticket, and also cover all transport costs within the city. We are happy to assist with booking your itinerary, but if you can do it yourself we can focus on making the conference even better.

Entry to the conference - please note that we may not be done with the speaker selections by the time tickets go on sale, so if you want to make sure you can attend, let us know in the form below and we’ll hold a ticket for you in case your talk is not selected.

Accommodation in a hotel - in close proximity to the venue and/or with a shuttle transfer arranged. For a day before and two days after the conference.
If you’d like to stay longer, we can help you arrange things, just let us know. You will have to cover any extra nights, though.

If your employer can cover your travel and hotel, we’ll be happy to list them as a company sponsor. The money we save will be invested into the general running of the conference and scholarships for attendees from underrepresented groups.

You’re welcome to bring your family. If you need childcare, please get in touch. We want to make sure your stay is as enjoyable as possible.

The venue and the hotel will be accessible for wheelchair users and people with reduced mobility. If you have any concerns or questions about whether all your needs can be met, please contact us.
