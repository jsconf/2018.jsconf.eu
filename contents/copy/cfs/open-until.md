## Open until January 1, 2018

We are inviting the JavaScript community to submit talks for the upcoming JSConf EU (June 2-3 2018, Berlin). This Call for Presentation **closes on Jan 1st**.

This is what we call a “Hybrid CFP”: If you think you have something great to talk about, tell us all about it and we consider your entry. If you know someone who has something great to talk about, nominate them. And if you are interested in hearing about a particular topic, nominate the topic, and we can try and find a match.
