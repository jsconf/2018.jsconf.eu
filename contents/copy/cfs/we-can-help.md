## We can help

Not everyone is a natural-born talent on stage. Not everyone can produce kick-ass slide decks. Not everyone is a live-demo master. Not everyone knows they have something great to talk about.

There are about a million reasons why you may not consider yourself a speaker. We are here to prove you wrong. If all you have is a gut feeling that you should be on stage, we are here to help you develop or hone the skills you think you lack to deliver a great presentation.

* We’d be happy to brainstorm your interests and seek great hidden ideas.
* We’d be happy to connect you with experienced speakers to help you prepare your submission.
* We’d be happy to review and advise on how to produce a slide deck. If you don't feel creative, just use our [Keynote or PowerPoint](https://github.com/jsconf/presentation-templates/downloads) templates.
* We’d be happy to rehearse via video chat with you.
* We can hook you up with local groups so you can practice in front of a friendly crowd.

Again, whatever else you might need, we’re here to help. Get in touch: [contact@jsconf.eu](mailto:contact@jsconf.eu ) (please don’t use this email to submit a proposal).
