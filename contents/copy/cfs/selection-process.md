## Selection Process

Hereâ€™s how we select our speakers:

1. All submissions are anonymized, so that there is no bias towards the submitter.
2. All submissions are reviewed and voted for by the conference organizers. Each talk is rated on a scale from 1 to 5, taking into account the following criteria:
  * relevance of the topic to the JS community
  * coherence and clarity of the proposal
novelty/originality of the topic
  * can the topic be reasonably covered in the allocated time
3. The top submissions are then de-anonymized so we can bias against speaker details. We wrote about this and more considerations that go into our curation and selection process here. [link to cssconf blog]

We expect a lot more excellent submissions than we have speaking slots. This process helps us select the best proposals, and hack our own unavoidable biases.
