We’re excited to introduce you to [some of the artists](/speakers/#artists) that will make JSConf 2018 even more special. Some joined us through the [Call for Artists](https://twitter.com/jsconfeu/status/920317478177087488) and others are familiar faces–but we can't tell you about everyone yet, because that would give too much away 🤣

The Live.js Network–together with some new friends–will have a very special role at the event that we're keeping quiet about. Just this much: JavaScript will be all around us. Check out their performance from ColdFront 2017:

Also, the [NESTED LOOPS](https://twitter.com/nested_loops?lang=en) have something new to show you. Check out their incredible performance from last year:

And then there is more. But you'll have to be there to really experience it. Let's just say: There will be LEDs. Synthesizers. And LEDs.

Check out our [artists page](/speakers/#artists) for a full list of the awesome people involved this year!
