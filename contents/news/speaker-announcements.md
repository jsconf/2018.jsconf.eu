title: First speaker announcements and more tickets on sale
date: 2018-02-21
----

We just started announcing the [first speakers for JSConf EU 2018](/speakers/). It’s going to take us a few weeks to get through all speakers and we’ll announce more speakers Tue/Wed/Thu for the next few weeks. The best way to follow the announcements may be to check out our [mega thread on Twitter!](https://twitter.com/jsconfeu/status/965954122519404547)

**Updated Feb 27:** In somewhat related news, our REGULAR tickets are [going on sale](https://ti.to/jsconfeu/jsconf-eu-2018/) this week with more batches following in the coming weeks! We will always have tickets on sale that include Diversity Scholarship Support, so you can always fall back on them, if you can’t make a batch. The next batches are [Thursday, March 1st, at 10:00 and 18:00 CET](https://ti.to/jsconfeu/jsconf-eu-2018/).
