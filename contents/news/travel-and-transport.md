We collected a bit of information about travel to and from JSConf EU, how to get around Berlin, and where to stay:

## Berlin’s Airports
Berlin has two airports, both of which are located close to the city center, a 30-minute taxi ride from the venue (ca. EUR 30). There are also trains and buses that connect the airports to Berlin’s city center.

- [Berlin-Tegel (TXL)](http://www.berlin-airport.de/en/travellers-txl/to-and-from/buses-and-trains/index.php)
- [Berlin-Schönefeld (SXF)](http://www.berlin-airport.de/en/travellers-sxf/to-and-from/buses-and-trains/index.php)

## Public Transport
Berlin has many public transport options. The subway, trains, buses, trams are all operated by [BVG](http://www.bvg.de/en). We recommend getting one of the [tourist tickets](https://shop.bvg.de/index.php/group/73) for the length of your stay – this will allow you to use all subway trains, trams and buses in all of Berlin, plus it comes with discounts for popular sights, museums, and other attractions.

## Bike
Berlin’s flat geography, its many [bike lanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_in_Berlin) and the [friendly weather in early June](http://www.yr.no/place/Germany/Berlin/Berlin/statistics.html) make it perfect to get around by bike! Check with your hotel or hostel if they have bikes to rent out, or find your perfect bike at one of the many [bike rental places](https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=bike+rental&find_loc=Berlin&start=0&cflt=bikerentals).

## Taxi
Taxis in Berlin are affordable and everywhere. You can usually hail one on the street, or use apps like [MyTaxi](https://de.mytaxi.com/en/index.html) to order one.

## Accommodation
Below are a two hotels we recommend, both a short walk away from our venue. If neither of those fit your needs, private accommodation options like [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com/) are great, too.

- [Holiday Inn (20 min walk)](https://www.ihg.com/holidayinn/hotels/us/en/berlin/berow/hoteldetail?cm_mmc=GoogleMaps-_-HI-_-DE-_-BEROW)
- [Michelberger Hotel (20 min walk)](http://michelbergerhotel.com/en/)
