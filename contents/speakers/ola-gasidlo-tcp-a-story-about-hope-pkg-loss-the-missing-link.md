Have you ever wondered, who is delivering those packages everyone on the
network is talking about and what they are? 
Why does the internet even get chopped in little packages and send all across
the globe? Don't they get lost? 
And do those which get lost ever find their way home?

As performance gets more and more important these days, 
lets step back from all of the optimization of the code and take a close look
at what lies underneath.

This talk will cover everything you need to know about the link layer wrapped
nicely with a golden bow.
