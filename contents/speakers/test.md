This would be a block of text about the speaker, something like a short biography of sorts.
We should be prepared to work with different content-lengths and so on.

Just for the heck of it, this example even gets a second paragraph.
And this one even [has a link in it](http://github.com/jsconf/2018.jsconf.eu).
